4. That's all, run examples/*



Registration
============

To download profiles from dating site, you need one or more registered 
accounts there. Below are instructions for specific dating service.

Mamba
-----

www.mamba.ru

Mamba has multiple restrictions for obtaining complete public profile 
information.

1. You cannot select more than five dating 'goals' (flirt/marriage/
blabla...), and these are the only goals you will see in girl profiles. 
To get complete information, you currently need two accounts to cover 
all those checkboxes. Just fetch the profile from at least two accounts, 
profile data in database will be merged automatically:

	my $me1 = ... # 1st account
	my $me2 = ... # 2nd account

        my $she = Dating::She->new_from_url ($profile_url, $me1);
	$she->update_from_page ($me2, pagekey => main);
        $she->sync_with_db ($dbh, $image_path, $me1);

See perdoc lib/Dating/She.pm for details.
See examples/30-fetch-from-dating-service.pl for example.

2. You need an email address for verification. Use temporary address
because mamba will sell it to spammers.

3. There are multiple restrictions for users without a photo.
Publicly available images are rejected, so perform some geometry 
manipulation: crop, non-linear resize.

4. User has an option to hide her profile from non-'real' users ('real' 
are those who confirmed their phone numbers by SMS), to see such profiles 
you need to confirm SMS in some way.

5. User also has an option to hide her profile from non-'VIP' users 
('VIP' are those crazies who paid money). Fortunately, girls who select 
this option are not suitable for dating, so you can safely ignore them.

6. If you don't choose at least three items in 'sex preferences', then 
no user sex preferences will be shown to you, so drop some junk there.

7. Don't select 'exclude profile from search' checkbox, or mamba 
will not allow _you_ to search.

8. Select Russian interface language as last step, if you used other 
than Russian for registration. This is important, or parser won't work.
It cannot work because mamba transliterates any manual user input 
to unusable mess if your interface language is set to English.

9. Number of profile viewings is limited to 200 per account per day.
Temporary ban currently isn't recognized correctly, so don't fetch 
more than 200 profiles per day from a single account.



Additional requirements 
for guessing user location in Mamba
-----------------------------------

Mamba shows you distance to users.

User position may be estimated from this data. See trilaterate() 
in lib/Dating/math.pm and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration.

To get this work, you need to fetch the profile in question from at least 
three accounts.

During account registration, select some exact location on the map, then 
reload page and look for your coordinates in page source. They look like:

	lat: 55.6424,
	lng: 24.8342,

Use these numbers when creating Dating::Me objects:

	my $me = Dating::Me->new ( 
	    login =>..., password =>..., location => "55.6424 24.8342");

See perldoc lib/Dating/Me.pm for details.

Place your three users at the vertices of triangle, surrounding the area 
in which you want to guess users locations. Don't make this triangle too
small, errors are 1-2 km.

Each time as profile in question is downloaded by another Dating::Me object,
the distance is stored in SQL. As soon as parse() gets third distance, 
it performs trilateration and stores the result in 'location' field 
of 'profiles' SQL table. Check:

	SELECT id,location FROM profiles WHERE location IS NOT NULL

Note that Mamba rejects your location if you come from IP address 
of different country. Use proxy in the subject country.

Once you used proxy and set your location on the map, never login without 
proxy, and never open any mamba page (saved from anywhere) in browser 
without proxy. This will readily leak your IP address via javascript and 
<link rel=, and mamba will reset your location, and even show it in 
'Travel' section in your profile.


If you have any trouble, question or idea, don't hesitate to contact 
Anatoly SchrÃ¶dinger <weirdo@noipmail.com> or use any github function.
